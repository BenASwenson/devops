# What is DevOps?
DevOps is a culture which bridges development and operations.  A developer is responsible for new product features, bug fixes, security updates and code refactoring.  After building a project, the development team needs to deploy to a development environment to check for integration and various other aspects of the product.  When deploying from development to production, warning and errors often occur.

Operations teams are responsible for managing servers, ensuring services are running, and that they are sufficiently monitored and growing capacity as the product or company scales and grows.  Operations are met with similar errors and warnings as the development team when deploying development products.

The key aspect of DevOps is to break down the silos that developers and operations work in and have the two teams working closer together, sharing responsibilities, deploying the infrastructure as code, and finally, automating the pipeline throughout.

These principles need to be supported by the engineering practices continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment, often known as CICD.


## Why Devops
With these DevOps principles in place, greater efficiency enables a faster time to market, improved team collaboration, continuous release cycles, automated scalable environments and increased quality due to automated testing.
